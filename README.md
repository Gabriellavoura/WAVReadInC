# WAVReadInC
------
Code for audio processing in C without using external or third-party libraries.

* The **ReadWav** folder contains a single code for reading **.wav** files and register it into a **.csv** spreadsheet that can easily be exported to a variable in *MATLAB* for comparison purposes.

* The **RMS** folder contains the code to calculate *RMS(Root Mean Square)* algorithm, using the **.csv** file generated by the *ReadWav* code, but is still development for more details see the **comments in the code**.
## RESULTS
------
Below is the comparison between the logs generated by the **ReadWav** code and generated by the [audioread()] function of *MATLAB*.
